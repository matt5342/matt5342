### Hi! I'm Matt 🙋‍♂️ 

I am a full-stack software engineer currently based in Maryland. I am passionate about learning and have a knack for picking things up quickly. I have extensive past experience in wine and beer production, where I learned to perform in fast-paced environments with time sensitive operations. I am a graduate from the Flatiron School and am on the hunt for a Software Engineer Role.
